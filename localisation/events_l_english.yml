They created a new world order controlled by greedy monarchists and capitalists, leading to the inhumane suffering of millions. The wise Daniel De Leon recognised this and gave birth to an ideology that lasts to this day, in Austria, Denmark and even in Africa. The incompetence of Napoleon VI created the perfect breeding ground for our revolution, but also right-wing totalitarians. This was proven today when the people's revolution clashed with that of the Strasserist military clique that attempted to take control of the government. Naturally, the will of the people triumphed and now our beautiful red France shall live on."

Countless victories in Europe, India, America and beyond solidified the place of this institution in our society. However, the credit for these monumental successes was always attributed to the Emperor, creating a political atmosphere of anger and mistrust within the army. With the incompetence of Napoleon VI reaching its peak in 1936, a small clique of officers began to conspire against him in the hopes of restoring order and dignity to France. Finally today they made their move and a new government was declared, resulting in clashes with the parasitic De Leonists.

Since then, the political situation has admittedly worsened, with the forces of De Leonism and Strasserism gradually gaining more influence. Although many say it was due to the incompetence of the Emperor, it was certainly foreign agents that created support for the radical factions. Nevertheless, this situation boiled into the two attempted coups today, one on either side of the capital.

The provinces in Bengal provided little economic prosperity back at home and many never had the money to purchase anything above their basic needs. This left a large portion of the population bitter, but not necessarily anti-Monarchist, rather anti-Manuel. However, over time this feeling did turn into Republicanism, and numerous parties were formed to take advantage of the political atmosphere. Not long ago, it was confirmed by the royal house that King Manuel had died of a heart attack. However, this gave the Americanists a situation to push forward their message, and thus, they called for immediate constitutional reform. The people's will overruled the family, and Americanism has been installed in Portugal."

But to this day, the country has remained relatively calm on the international stage, engaging in aggressive diplomacy instead. With its neighbours, France has created an uneasy relationship, culminating in various ultimatums from Paris. Last night, demands were sent to the Croatian government stating that unless the region of Istria was ceded to imperial forces immediately, a state of war would exist between the two nations. With this demand being completely unexpected by the Zagreb government, the foreign ministry scrambled to provide a proper response. After a few hours, it was thus decided that Istria would be given to France."

While this is a huge loss for the red governments in Vienna and throughout Europe, it is clear that such an alliance may not hold, due to the lack of major industry in Scotland, which would act as protection against Southern invaders.

The French protection would essentially make the Kongo a vassal of the expanding empire, and a bulwark against aggressive actions from countries such as East Africa and the Gold Coast.

Today, the Treaty of Versailles was signed by powers on the winning side, with no French diplomats to be seen."

[From.GetFactionName] have made public their intent to cooperate in the case of war.\n\nAlthough great coalitions can deter against aggression, we've seen the consequences they bring when conflict does arise. The intentions of the different parties joining in this new alliance is still debatable, but what purpose it may end up serving may be unknown even to its instigators."
