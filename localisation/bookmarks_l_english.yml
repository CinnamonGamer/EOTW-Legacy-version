 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Emperor of the World"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It has been decades since the first Napoleon died, and yet his totalitarian influence still stretches across the world, from Europe to the Americas and Asia to Africa. Although a great power, France's enemies, bitter from their past defeats to the empire, are poised to strike and reclaim all that they have lost. Ideologies are clashing, empires are crumbling and still the darkest days of the world are yet to come."
 ENG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A once powerful United Kingdom was brought to its knees in the Napoleonic wars, being divided and Balkanized at the most historical peace conference ever. The De Leonists in the Scottish Highlands are strengthening, and a united Ireland has weakened the influence of the English navy. Can Britannia rise again?"
 FRA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "More than a century ago, the great Napoleon conquered as far as the eye could see, from Portugal to Moscow and Berlin to Naples. Since then, the French Empire has expanded her influence and strength throughout the world, confirming the nation's place as the only great power. However, this rapid expansion has left many distasteful towards the Emperor, and would happily see him dead, exiled or simply begging for mercy. Has France's luck run out, or is this just the beginning?"
 CHI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "By the mid-19th century, the Qing dynasty was rapidly losing control over its own populace. Revolution became a very real possibilty throughout the enormous empire, and it was sure to happen within the next few decades. But seeing this and siezing the opportunity, the new great power of France offered unbelievable support to China, crushing revolts as soon as they rose, all the while establishing more and more influence in Asia. But now, the relatively ungrateful Qing have the empire under control, and are finally ready to unite the celestial kingdom!"
 TUR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since the 1400s, the Ottoman Empire has grown exponentially, conquering vast lands from Europe to Libya. With this power, the Sultans enjoyed relative calm and stability at home while the troops marched with ease through capitals and villages. However, in the past century, revolts in Africa and the Balkans have revealed cracks in the Ottoman juggernaut. The 1936 parliament, formed after the Sultan was forced to create a legislative body, now has the monarchy at breaking point, with Turkish nationalism and Americanist movements leading the nation to full democracy, with or without a monarch. Can the empire rise again, or will submitting to internal pressures ease rebellious tensions?"
 SOV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The late 19th century was a period of turmoil for the Russian Empire. Rapidly spreading disease in the East and a worrying lack of food and resources in the West led to frequent revolts that would quickly be put down by the army. This period seemingly ended in the 1900s, when the Tsar retook control of industry and overall the people, providing nationalised healthcare and food. However, this would be short-lived, and another famine struck the entire nation, including the capital. In response, a group of religious clerics seized control and now Russia is a theocratic dictatorship."
 USA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the Great Wars of the early 1800s, the United States was just a newly independent nation awaiting opportunities for expansion. As the conflict raged in Europe, tensions between France and the USA reached an all-time high, culminating in a border skirmish which then in turn became outright war. Washington quickly lost this conflict and since then the nation has remained isolated from the world, with many despising its system. However, a growth of Americanist movements in the world could lead to a new USA-led order."
 OTHER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The nations of the world, great and small, are not all content to hold their breath awaiting the outbreak of another global conflict. From major powers on the brink of civil war to the many nations formed and transformed by the Great Wars, all will have to make difficult decisions and balance ideals with pragmatism to have an impact on the future of the world."
